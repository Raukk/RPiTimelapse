# RPiTimelapse
Simple Python scripts for a robust Raspberry Pi based Timelapse Camera

The hardware is a Raspi 4 (8GB), 64GB SD card, a NoIR cammera module, and some 3M wall tabs.

I wrote this code because I wanted to record a timelapse of my sleep.
If you wish to use this for things like night sky timelapses, you will probably want to tweak it quite a bit.

If you run this on other hardware, you will probably have to tweak things.

I added things to the Cron tab to have them (hopefully) start automatically.



Note: Python and Linux are not my daily drivers, so, if I made a dumb mistake, let me know.
